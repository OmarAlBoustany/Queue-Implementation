# Queue-Implementation
Assignment 2 - CSC213

Create a template class that represents the Queue Data Structure in C++ as a visual studio project. In class we have designed the concept of a stack. The Queue works in a First in First Out manner (FIFO). It has a head and a tail (first item and last item) and 5 operations enqueue and dequeue (to add an item to the tail and to pop an item from the head), isEmpty and isFull to check the queue components and Peek that shows the first item on the head. Follow the link below to better understand how the queue works.
